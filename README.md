# README

This application is a Fencing Club. Students can sign up so that they can set up lessons with coaches. Students can view coaches, edit their profiles, and take lessons. 

To use this applcation, a user can travel to the homepage and sign up with either a platform username and password or use their Github profile to authenticate. Once they use their Github profile, they'll be given the chance to edit their profile and add in all necessary data elements. 

They can view coaches and filter by years of experience or region. This will help narrow down a student's options for lessons. 

Once a user decides on a coach, they can choose to schedule a lesson by selecting a month, date, year, and time. Lessons are available in 1 hour incredments. Once it's time for their lesson, students can select the lesson, view it, and elect to take the lesson. Students can also cancel lessons.

Enjoy using the Fencing Club application!
